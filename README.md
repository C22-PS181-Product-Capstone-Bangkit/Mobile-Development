  Cemil: Choose Your Meal
  
</h1>

<p align="center">Cemil is a restaurant recommendation app which can provide restaurant recommendations<br/>
to users by learning about their history and preferences.
<br/><br/>With Cemil, users can save time and effort when deciding where to eat, while meeting new/existing restaurants.</p>


<br/>

# Background
> Choice overload is an adverse effect of too many available choices on our decision-making ability.
> 
> We have limited cognitive resources, so having more options to consider drains our mental energy more quickly.
> 
> Less is not always a bad idea. Cutting down the menu could increase the revenue.

We develop Cemil because we want to tackle the problem of choice overloading when people are picking food to eat. <br/><br/>
Cemil can help people from wasting too much of their time when choosing what they want to eat.
On top of that, Cemil provides an opportunity to help restaurants business grow in terms of economic and tourism, by introducing and recommending them to the public.
